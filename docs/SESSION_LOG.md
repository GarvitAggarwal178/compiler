## 2026-08-20 — Phase 0 probe

**What changed:** Repo laid out per CLAUDE.md §3 (`docs/`, `harness/`, `tests/`,
`fixtures/`, `measurements/`, `tools/`; no `src/`, per instructions). `architecture.md`
moved to `docs/dlc-blueprint.md`. Git repo initialized. Soufflé 2.5 installed from
release `.deb` (`docs/DECISIONS.md`). Wrote `harness/probe0.py` (seeded fixture
generation for P1/P2/P3, verifies P1's reachable-from-1 set before running anything,
drives Soufflé with and without `--magic-transform=*`, profiles each run),
`harness/parse_profile.py` (exact per-relation tuple counts from Soufflé's JSON
profile log, since `souffleprof`'s text table rounds), `harness/extract_exact.py`
(runs the parser against all six logs with full provenance). Wrote the three `.dl`
programs verbatim from blueprint §12 to `tests/programs/`.

**Measurement IDs produced:** `probe0-p{1,2,3}-{off,on}-{run,profile,extract}` (18
directories), each self-contained under `measurements/<id>/` with
`cmd.txt`/`stdout.txt`/`stderr.txt`/`env.txt`/`meta.json`, plus Soufflé's own raw
output (`.csv`, `.log`) for the `-run` IDs. Full table in `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`.

**What is now blocked:** Phase 1. Three CLAUDE.md §5 STOP conditions fired: Soufflé's
`--magic-transform=*` transformed relations containing negation on both P2 and P3
(contradicting the blueprint's stated premise and its own worked STOP example);
`T_magic(P1) > T_base(P1)`; P1's magic/no-magic ratio (≈1) misses the blueprint's
stated ~10^3 expectation by more than one order of magnitude. Full escalation with
three live explanations and one proposed (unrun) distinguishing experiment
(`--inline-exclude=q`) is in `docs/reports/probe0.md`.

**Single next action:** Human decides among the three live explanations in
`docs/reports/probe0.md` (Soufflé version drift / Soufflé already guard-equivalent /
P3-specific inlining artifact) and whether to authorize the `--inline-exclude=q`
follow-up experiment before Phase 1 starts.
